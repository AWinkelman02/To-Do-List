# To-Do-List

Description:

This project uses HTML CSS and Javascript to build a functioning To-Do List/Project tracker. The webpage allows users to create a list of Projects that they may be working on and then add tasks to said project. The tasks include information such as title, description, due date, whether the task is completed, and any additional notes the user may want to add to the task. Along with creating projects and tasks, the user can filter the tasks to show what is due on the current date and what is due in the current week. 

Technology Used:

The main focus of this project was to use more advanced Javascript tools such as classes to create objects, ES6 modules to organize code, and webpack to bundle the code/assets when it gets deployed.

Challenges:

The first challenge I faced was the proper use of webpack. This was the first time I was introduced to webpack so it was difficult to properly use at the start. As time went on with this project, I became more comfortable and more proficient with its usage.

The next challenge was learning how to store data in a local storage. With the project focusing on tracking progression through projects, it was imperative that this progress was stored for future use and not just during a single session. Using local storage allowed more permanent storage of the data created. 

Finally, the use of external libraries was challenging in the beginning. I had to learn how to properly instal these libraries and include them in my code. This challenge was short lived as I quickly became comfortable with this process.
